By far, the most difficult step is the first one. It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s anything particularly difficult about it, but it does carry the initial friction that comes with beginning. _That&#8217;s_ the difficult part.

The initial work will seem like it isn&#8217;t worth it, that you should push it on for the next day. But you need to press on, because it&#8217;s the only way to ever get to the point in which that initial friction isn&#8217;t there. To do that, you need to _start_.

The longest and most rewarding journeys begin with the first step. And then the next, until you look back and see just how far you&#8217;ve come.
