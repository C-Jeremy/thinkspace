If you&#8217;re not, you won&#8217;t have longevity in _any_ craft. Instead, you&#8217;ll jump from one activity to another, always ready to call it quits when training gets difficult and you find that you&#8217;re wrong.

The best performers in any craft are those who put themselves out on the line every day, working hard and not worrying about being wrong. They _know_ they&#8217;ll be wrong at one point, but they also realize that they _can_ be wrong, as long as they&#8217;re willing to change.

That last part is what people often miss. Being wrong is fine, and it can help you grow into a person who knows more than before they were wrong. However, being _willing_ to change is just as important, for it&#8217;s what completes the learning that begun when they were wrong. Therefore, being willing to be wrong, _and then_ doing something about it is so important if you want to stay relevant in your craft.

In the end, you have to not care about being wrong, but about changing your mindset when the evidence shows that it&#8217;s better to think a different way. The best aren&#8217;t floppers, they&#8217;re people who know what it takes to improve.
