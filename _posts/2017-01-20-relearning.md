The secret to my skill in running is simple: I practice every day. Virtually every day I go for a run, which means I give my body more practice to become familiar with the act of running. Assuming I&#8217;m not solidifying bad running habits, it&#8217;s simply a matter of time that I improve. Since I dedicate so much time to running, my body is never &#8220;surprised&#8221; by the act of running.

However, this attitude is not often taken for school. Instead, we assume that once a student has passed a class, they have learnt that material from that moment onward. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing for those who have good marks, but when someone barely passes a course, it is probably unfair to say that they have learnt and absorbed all the content.

Personally, I find my mathematics classes tend to stay with me the longest, because they are used in all of my other classes and they &#8220;pile up&#8221; on top of each other as I delve deeper into mathematics. Still, there are some ideas that slip through the cracks and don&#8217;t get used often. Once that happens, it&#8217;s easy to forget how to deal with that kind of situation.

This is why I think it&#8217;s great to periodically look back and ask yourself if you&#8217;ve lost anything important that you had once learnt. If the answer is yes, take some time to go back and understand the idea. By doing this, you&#8217;re setting yourself up to forget less of the content you learned years ago. Additionally, it&#8217;s a good idea because older ideas you&#8217;ve learnt tend to crop up later on in different courses, so it never hurts to learn some material another time. Just a quick refresher can make a concept that much clearer in your mind once again, and it&#8217;s generally easier to relearn it than to go through it the first time.
