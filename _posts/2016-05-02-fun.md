Think of the last time you did something for _fun_. Not for work, not because you felt like you &#8220;needed&#8221; to. Instead, doing an activity with the pure intention of enjoying yourself as much as possible. It may have been a new sport, or a creative pursuit. What mattered was that it was something completely different than your regular schedule, and was just done for the joy and curiosity of trying a new activity.

Seems like a long time ago, huh?

Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve become accustomed to keeping to schedules, not allowing ourselves room for flexibility and enjoyment. Instead, it has become about hitting strict goals that are aimed at improving ourselves in a certain pursuit. It&#8217;s a reality that is more rigid, less allowing of removing oneself from the discipline of consistent training.

It&#8217;s entirely okay to commit to one pursuit in particular and hone&#8217;s one&#8217;s skills in that craft for their entire life, but there has to be _some_ kind of activity that they can do to just enjoy themselves, without the expectation or _necessity_ of performance.

Performance is great, but it doesn&#8217;t have to come at the cost of enjoying activities with others from time to time.
