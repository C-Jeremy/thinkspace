We have an outdated approach to pronouns.

Technically speaking, if we are referring to a generic person, we should refer to this person as &#8220;he or she&#8221;. This is to keep the person as a universal entity, not shrouded by one specific gender[^1]. However, as one of my main philosophies about communication (and writing in particular) is &#8220;keep it brief&#8221;, I find the use of &#8220;he or she&#8221; to be completely absurd. It&#8217;s a nuisance when I write, and I always hated myself for doing it, even though it was _technically_ correct.

Fast forward to now, and I don&#8217;t care anymore. I&#8217;ve found the pronoun I&#8217;m going to use going forward, and it&#8217;s &#8220;they&#8221;. Anytime I see someone refer to people as &#8220;guys&#8221;, or to a person as &#8220;he&#8221;, I simply find it strange and exclusive.

I first came across this idea from [Sean Carroll](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/01/12/thats-just-what-they-would-say/), and I have to say, it reflects my sentiments exactly. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the word &#8220;they&#8221;, and it captures precisely what I want to convey: a generic person, with no gender attached. By all means, _use_ whatever mental model you&#8217;ve built up in your head. I don&#8217;t want to impose either one, nor do I want to &#8220;keep score&#8221; to make sure I&#8217;ve balanced my use of male and female pronouns. The truth is, it&#8217;s not important enough for me to try and keep count, and so &#8220;they&#8221; is the winner.

The word is more universal _and_ a fewer number of words in total. In my mind, that&#8217;s a win-win situation for everyone.

[^1]: Of course, I&#8217;m talking about males. We seem to be trying to establish ourselves everywhere, to the expense of our opposite gender. It actually bothers me quite a bit when I read someone who I admire and who has great ideas, yet keeps on using the male pronoun, as if it&#8217;s the only one available in existence. Conversely, I&#8217;ve _also_ become annoyed with the people who go to the other end of the extreme and only use female pronouns. Come on people, we can find a middle ground.
