Since I just finished up my exams for the semester, I&#8217;ve noticed a funny trend that most students seem to engage in. I call it &#8220;last-minute stuffing&#8221;, and it just refers to the minutes before a test where students quiz themselves and try to remember a bunch of information that they memorized.

At my university, the exams are mostly held in our sports complex, since there&#8217;s a bunch of room. Right before the exams, all the students taking the exam are bunched in the hallway outside, and this is where I hear the muttering and recitation going on. I can almost hear the desperation in some of their voices as they try to explain a concept to their friends but can&#8217;t quite get it, and how they try to memorize the way to do certain problems.

I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m faking it to seem more in control than I really am, but this has almost never been something I did. The only time I remember doing this is when I was trying to remember a the different scenarios for trig substitution when I was about to enter a test that wasn&#8217;t integral calculus, but differential equations, where it _could_ pop up. The reason I did that was because we never really worked with trig substitution in a while, and I needed to remember at least the first step.

Barring that, I won&#8217;t engage in this type of last-minute rush. The reason is simple: it&#8217;s not necessary. I reminded my friends of this as they too looked around with me and saw a bunch of people trying to recite things about the test. I said, &#8220;What you look at in the next five minutes isn&#8217;t going to change your mark to a drastic degree (if at all). The fact is that we&#8217;ve looked at the subject for three months, so all the work that we&#8217;ve done has prepared us for the test.&#8221;

That&#8217;s what I find people seem to forget during exam season. Tests aren&#8217;t aced by studying a bunch at the last minute (at least, I&#8217;d say that this isn&#8217;t the case for most people). Rather, it&#8217;s through learning and working throughout the semester.

You&#8217;ve done the work all semester, so now you just have to show that.
