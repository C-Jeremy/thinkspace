As of this moment, I&#8217;m in my second year of undergraduate studies in physics. Therefore, I&#8217;ve seen a bunch of classical topics (electricity and magnetism, mechanics, wave motion, elementary astrophysics) while only seeing a snippet of &#8220;modern&#8221; physics (special relativity, mostly in the form of time dilation). I haven&#8217;t taken any classes on quantum mechanics, so I&#8217;m definitely a novice there.

On the mathematics side, I&#8217;ve taken the usual classes of calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. In a sense, I&#8217;m still learning the techniques before actually applying them to topics such as topology.

As you can see, I&#8217;m just starting to really dip my feet into my mathematics and physics training.

However, this hasn&#8217;t stopped me from pushing my boundaries and learning about other topics. I follow a variety of mathematics and physics blogs that I try and keep up with while reading. Additionally, I watch many video series which are part of the new swath of educational videos, such as [PhysicsGirl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DdEm33SyaTDtWYGO2CwdA), [Infinite Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4aHmggTfFrpkPcWSaBN9g), [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) and [PBS Spacetime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g) (probably the best channel that I&#8217;ve found online). I also read books here and there that push my comfort zone in terms of physics and mathematics.

The point is that I don&#8217;t back down from being completely bamboozled. In fact, I _want_ to find those places where I&#8217;m baffled, because they point to new opportunities to learn, which is always exciting. I also think that while I may not understand everything I read or watch, it can spark my curiosity to learn about it some more. Sometimes, it&#8217;s good to just have your head explode from not understanding.

At the same time, don&#8217;t just ignore what you can&#8217;t understand and move on. Instead, _think_ about the problem and what&#8217;s fuzzy in your mind, and you&#8217;ll usually be able to form a plan to figure out what you need to learn. From there, you can give yourself a boost in your education without necessarily waiting for the appropriate classes at school. This is even more relevant when studying topics that aren&#8217;t part of your field, since self-study is the only opportunity you will usually get.

Take advantage of the wealth of information available to you (much of it free), and learn. It&#8217;s probably the best investment of time you can make.
