When you&#8217;re trying to become a master at your craft, some days can be more difficult than others. At times, you may feel like it&#8217;s all you can do not to throw your hands in the air in defeat and give up. It can be very tempting, particularly when you&#8217;ve faced some setbacks. During these moments, it might take an extraordinary amount of effort to actually get up and continue making progress in your work.

A useful strategy that I&#8217;ve found is to shift your mindset. Instead of feeling as if you are slogging through your work, think, &#8220;I _get_ to do this.&#8221; By reminding yourself that you&#8217;re _happy_ to do this and that you aren&#8217;t being _forced_ to do it, you can shift your mindset into the right direction. This is something I employ often, because it works so brilliantly.

When your training feels like it&#8217;s all pointless and you aren&#8217;t getting anywhere, remind yourself of this simple fact: you get to _choose_ to do this, which means you&#8217;re doing it because it is important to you.

From there, it is much easier to get out of those darker moments during a bad training block.
