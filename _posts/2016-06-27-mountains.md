If you ever want to feel small, try climbing up a mountain. It&#8217;s during times like these that I feel like my journey is huge, almost impossible.

When I&#8217;m at the bottom, the mountain feels insurmountable, its peak rising in the air so high that it towers over the rest of the area. At the bottom, there&#8217;s a slight fear present. _Can I do this?_

Whereas at the top, _I_ now feel insurmountable. I&#8217;ve conquered the mountain with my own two legs, and it feels incredible. Furthermore, the fear I had at the bottom seems ridiculous. Of _course_ I was able to climb the mountain!

But it&#8217;s the journey _between_ these two states that is so interesting. How did I go from two very extreme states of emotion? What changed as I climbed the mountain?

The answer, it seems, is that I broke my journey down into smaller steps, and then got to work. I didn&#8217;t look up to see how much climbing was left to do every minute, nor did I look backwards to admire my progress. I didn&#8217;t lose sight of my micro-goal: putting one foot in front of the other. I put my head down and got to work.

_That&#8217;s_ how you accomplish these kinds of big goals. It&#8217;s not through looking at the big picture, but through focusing on the small steps, concentrating on completing those before worrying about the big picture.

And when the big picture _is_ revealed, it&#8217;s a wonderful shock to the system, because you weren&#8217;t expecting it. You&#8217;ve gone from bottom of the mountain to top of the mountain in one go, which creates a sensation of euphoria.

Therefore, the key isn&#8217;t to stand in awe at the immense grandeur of your journey. Instead, it&#8217;s to buckle down and do the work, letting yourself appreciate it afterwards.

By taking small steps towards your goal, you&#8217;ll soon find that you have climbed the mountain.
