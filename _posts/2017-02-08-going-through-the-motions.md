When you know how to do something, it can often be repetitive and tedious to continue practicing. After all, you _know_ exactly what you need to do, so why should you do more of it? This is something I&#8217;ve frequently asked myself, particularly when I&#8217;m in the middle of doing strength work after a run. I know I have to do it, but it&#8217;s not exactly _easy_ to go and actually commit that time every single day. Likewise, many of us _know_ that we aren&#8217;t giving our eyes the proper rest before sleep (and we probably aren&#8217;t sleeping enough), yet we stop ourselves from going and doing the thing we know we should.

This isn&#8217;t a new idea, and it&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve mentioned in various forms here before. If we want to get better at doing something, we need to _do_ it. It&#8217;s a nice idea that merely thinking about the thing will result in our improvement, but it&#8217;s not true. That&#8217;s why I find it so important to practice doing a bunch of questions before a test, or why I bother putting so much effort in assignments. It&#8217;s not because I necessarily _like_ doing it all the time. Rather, it&#8217;s because this effort directly relates to the grades I want to get.

It&#8217;s not always fun to go through the motions of an activity, but it&#8217;s the best way to improve. On the whole, hard work is rewarded with better grades, and so that&#8217;s what you should do if academic achievement is your goal.
