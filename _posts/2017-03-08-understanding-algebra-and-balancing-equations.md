If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned about mathematics during my many years at school, it&#8217;s that having a solid foundational understanding of the main components can go a long way towards learning new subjects within mathematics. Unfortunately, this is what is often lacking for students, and it can have the knock-on effect of making later concepts more difficult to grasp.

As a tutor, the concept I see students struggling the most in secondary is a basic understanding of algebra and how equations work. This becomes evident to me because the concepts I&#8217;m supposed to help students with aren&#8217;t necessarily knowing how to manipulate equations, yet this is exactly the aspect they struggle with. I feel like most of the students I help don&#8217;t have a solid grasp of what it means to have an equation (or solve a system of equations), which is why I wanted to go over the common mistakes I see.

## Mistake One: Flipping Signs

Here&#8217;s an equation:

$$5x+7=2$$

If you want to solve this, the step-by-step method involves bringing the 7 over to the other side, followed by bring the 5 over as well, giving us an answer for $x$. However, the mistake I often see here is one of the following:

  * Bringing the 7 to the other side like this:
  
    $$5x = 2 + 7$$
  * Or bring the 5 over like this:
  
    $$x = \frac{2-7}{-5}$$

In both of these cases, the mistake is one of signs. I remember when I was first learning this, I would try to simply remember that multiplication and division doesn&#8217;t include flipping signs when &#8220;crossing&#8221; over to the other side of an equation, and that I _would_ have to flip signs if it was addition or subtraction. This is how I learned it at the beginning, but it definitely wasn&#8217;t a good method.

The reason is that mathematics is logical. If you can&#8217;t figure out why something ends up being the way it is in an answer, it&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t fully understand it. In this case, I was content to just remember my rule for flipping the signs, but that made me disregard real reason why my rule worked. Now, I have a better understanding of how these equations work, and so I don&#8217;t have to remember my rule.

I think the trouble stems from the way we talk about these equations. When we&#8217;re solving for $x$ as in the above equation, we talk about &#8220;bringing&#8221; numbers to the right-hand side in order to isolate our variable. However, the word &#8220;bringing&#8221; is pretty vague, and ends up having a different meaning depending on if we are talking about the 7 or the 5 in our example. What we _really_ mean when we say, &#8220;bring 7 to the other side&#8221; is to _subtract_ 7 from both sides of the equation, like so:

$$5x + 7 - 7 = 2 - 7$$

From here, it&#8217;s much more clear what&#8217;s going to happen. The 7s on the left-hand side will cancel, and the one on the right will be subtracted from 2. There&#8217;s no need to think about flipping signs. Instead, it&#8217;s all about what it will take to get the seven away from one side of the equation.

It&#8217;s also important to note that this works because you&#8217;re doing something to _both_ sides of the equation. I always find it&#8217;s useful to think of an equation as a balance. Therefore, if you add something to one side, you have to add the same amount to the other if you want the balance to remain in equilibrium.

Likewise, once we have isolated $5x$ and want to find out what $x$ is, we simply need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. When thinking about equations this way, it makes perfect sense that you won&#8217;t be flipping the sign, since you want to isolate $x$ through dividing both sides by 5.

## Mistake Two: Not Following The Order of Operations

This one&#8217;s more common when students are first learning, but it&#8217;s still something I see quite often. Let&#8217;s return to our example:

$$5x + 7 = 2$$

Sometimes, I see a student do something along these lines:

$$x + 7 = \frac{2}{5}$$

To the student, this makes sense, since I they want to &#8220;bring&#8221; the 5 to the other side of the equation. Unfortunately, this disregards the 7, which is a problem. To help them see this, I ask, &#8220;What did you do to bring the 5 to the other side?&#8221; Usually, the response will be something along the lines of, &#8220;I brought the 5 to the other side, so it&#8217;s now a division.&#8221;

Once again, this shows the danger of using language like &#8220;bringing over&#8221;, because it masks what the student is _actually_ doing. Once I tell them that in order to &#8220;bring&#8221; something to the opposite side of an equation, they have to do the same operation on _both_ sides of the equation, I show them how that includes dividing the 7 as well. It&#8217;s not necessarily intuitive to them at first, but once I get them on board with the idea of operating on _both_ sides of the equation, they begin to see how they cannot just transport a number to the other side and do the inverse operation. They have to do it on _both_ sides. This also shows them how isolating for a variable and _then_ dividing or multiplying each side usually avoids this common mistake.

* * *

These are just a few mistakes I&#8217;ve seen through tutoring students and getting them used to manipulating equations. It&#8217;s not always easy for me to see their difficulties, since years of practice makes manipulating equations for me an easy process, but I try to find concrete arguments and reasons to show them where their mistakes are and _why_ they are mistakes. It can be horribly confusing to be told that your answer is wrong, while not being given any explanation. As such, I try to be mindful that the best way to make students understand their mistakes is to show them situations in which their mistake obviously makes no sense. From there, I can lead them to becoming more comfortable with algebra and equations.
