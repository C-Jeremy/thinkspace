If you want to a task done, there are two different methods you can rely on. Of course, there&#8217;s the method of waiting for motivation to strike. In this situation, you only begin working on the problem when you _feel_ like it. In other words, you wait for inspiration to strike.

The flip side of that method is the one of routine. For this one, the key part is that you&#8217;re showing up to do the work independent of your mood towards it. This means you aren&#8217;t waiting for a large amount of motivation to tackle the situation. Instead, you&#8217;re doing the work because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve trained yourself to do, whether or not you &#8220;want to&#8221;.

Both methods can work, but the former results in much less work being produced. When you have to wait for motivation to come, it is easy to continuously put off doing the work because you just &#8220;aren&#8217;t in the right mood&#8221;. If you work on a routine, however, you&#8217;re showing up to produce because it&#8217;s a habit, not because you feel like it.

Therefore, the distinction between these two methods is that one has you practicing a lot more. Sure, you may not have &#8220;perfect&#8221; days that you may expect from someone who waits for strong motivation to strike, but let&#8217;s be honest: Those days are few and far between, and so we need to still find a way to do the work that matters. The most critical time is when you _don&#8217;t_ feel like continuing.

Reliance on motivation can produce good work, but it&#8217;s not nearly as effective as relying on showing up every day, regardless of your motivation.
