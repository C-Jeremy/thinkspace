One of the most hated things in all of school is the speech. Students _hate_ talking by themselves in front of a room full of peers. This usually has something to do with students not wanting to look ridiculous in front of their peers. Personally, I never had too much of a problem with presenting in front of a bunch of others, but I wasn&#8217;t necessarily a natural either. My strategy consisted of trying to memorize my presentation as much as possible, but at the same time, I never _fully_ had my presentation down. Therefore, I&#8217;d be walking a thin tightrope to not trip up on my presentation while still trying to sound natural.

Most of the time, it worked, but _I_ knew that I was more or less faking it the entire time. I was trying to make it seem like I knew everything, though I didn&#8217;t. (To be fair, I was still good at presentations, but I always noticed this internally.)

I can&#8217;t help but notice the similarities between those presentations and how students need to approach tests at school. Whether it be in physics, chemistry, biology, or mathematics, students rarely go into a test feeling completely comfortable. Therefore, they are banking on the fact that the teacher will not ask difficult questions on the test that are in their &#8220;weak spot&#8221;.

Despite being pretty good at mathematics and physics, I&#8217;m frequently in this position. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t know my material. It&#8217;s that there&#8217;s such a large amount of concepts that need to be known that it can be difficult to keep track of it in one&#8217;s head without forgetting a few things. Honestly, the only thing way I&#8217;ve found to permanently store concepts in my mind is through continued use over several semesters&#8217; worth of classes, which is obviously too long to be useful for any specific test. I frequently catch myself in a new class and doing something that seemed so difficult just a few semesters ago and finding that it is straightforward now.

The problem is that there&#8217;s a tension between time and becoming comfortable with the material. Two and a half years after my first calculus course, I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with taking derivatives of most functions. But now, taking a derivative is supposed to be like doing simple arithmetic. New challenges have arisen in my courses, so those are what cause me trouble.

There&#8217;s no easy solution to this. The simplest solution is to do a lot of practice problems. Unfortunately, that takes a lot of time and so you are limited in what you can do. Therefore, the other strategy I take is to try and cover all my bases by doing problems that are vastly different in what they pose. Then, when I find one that I am struggling with, I focus on doing a few of _those_ kinds of problems, and then I move on. This way, I&#8217;m not staying too narrowly focused on one topic.

The name of the game in school is to arrive on the test with as little need to &#8220;fake it&#8221; as possible. By exposing oneself to all the different scenarios and questions that can pop up, you&#8217;re giving yourself the best chance to be prepared to do well on the test.
