Are your goals taking up all of your waking hours?

Do you have enough time to just _sit_, doing nothing?

These are the types of questions that must be answered, and reviewed often. It&#8217;s just too easy to fall into the whirlwind of life and forget our reasons for doing what we do. It&#8217;s a subtle shift, happening over the course of weeks and months. But suddenly, you find yourself stuck in a series of tasks that seem to never end. What was once a craft that you enjoyed now seems like another box to check.

The key to stopping yourself from just marching on and overloading yourself with your goals is to actively reflect on what you are doing, and how you are giving yourself a balance in your activities. It may sound obvious, but without balance you are on a collision course for burnout. It&#8217;s as simple as that.

Therefore, you need to remember that going about your day and fulfilling all of your tasks in order to accomplish your goals can lead to a state of zombie-like consciousness. This is where the love for your craft can be lost.

Don&#8217;t let it come to that. Regularly reflect on what you&#8217;re doing, and _why_ you&#8217;re doing it.
