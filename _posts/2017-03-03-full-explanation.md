What is the one thing in mathematics or physics you feel completely comfortable with? In other words, which concept do you find you have grasped to such a degree that you&#8217;re able to get a good grasp on any problem concerning it? For myself, the mathematic concept that I feel pretty comfortable with is the idea of tangent lines and planes to certain functions (multivariable or not). I&#8217;m not saying that I understand a problem within three seconds, but I&#8217;m generally able to figure out the solution without too much difficulty. In physics, the concept I&#8217;m comfortable with is waves. I&#8217;m able to write equations for the wave-like motion of various objects and phenomena, and I&#8217;m good at extracting information out of them. Therefore, that would be my most comfortable area at the moment.

(Of course, it may come as no surprise that I&#8217;m comfortable with these two areas because I&#8217;ve recently taken a class on them. As such, it&#8217;s not exactly surprising that I&#8217;m used to them.)

However, there are plenty of concepts which I am _not_ familiar with. In mathematics, I always get caught up when I have to deal with chords in a circle or if I have to use hyperbolas and other not-frequently used functions. In physics, the concepts of energy, torque, moments of inertia, and other physics related to rotating bodies can often throw me for a loop.

The reason, I think, is that I never had a full, thorough explanation of most of these concepts. As such, I&#8217;m always operating on a level that includes a _bit_ of knowledge, but not necessarily one that makes me confident that I know what to do. In other words, I have a shaky foundation. And, as we all know, a shaky foundation has consequences for later on. When we aren&#8217;t comfortable with a subject, the problems will only resurface in other concepts later on.

To combat this, I&#8217;m setting myself a goal of filling the holes of my knowledge and finding those full explanations that I might have missed at different points in my education. That way, I&#8217;ll be improving my foundation so that I can actually move forward and not be so confused with concepts.

If I can offer one piece of advice, it is this: don&#8217;t settle for half-explanations. When learning, make sure that you understand the concepts to a point that you are completely comfortable with the ideas. If you have questions, make sure you ask them. Don&#8217;t worry about seeming &#8220;dumb&#8221; or not knowing enough. What&#8217;s more important is that _you_ understand, and nothing else.
