Improvement, in the end, is a game of nanometres.

The objective in one&#8217;s craft isn&#8217;t to become a genius or a master overnight. This is an impossible task. Instead, a more successful approach is to try and improve everything, a little bit at a time. This encourages a mindset of improvement, no matter how small. Sure, you won&#8217;t get any massive gains. But over time, the little improvements add up, and create the change you are looking for.
