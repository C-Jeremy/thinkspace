Back when I was in CÃ‰GEP, I spent my summer months working as a gardener. It was a radical change from my usual routine of doing mathematics and physics to planting flowers and cleaning flower beds in the heat of the summer. It wasn&#8217;t bad by any means, but it was quite different from what one would normally expect myself to do. In essence, it was a job of convenience. I didn&#8217;t hate it, but I did look forward to doing something else. In fact, I remember telling my coworkers for multiple summers that I was working as a gardener only until I could finally work in my own domain of interest.

Fast-forward to now, and I finally have that job I&#8217;ve wanted. I&#8217;m working as a summer research assistant for one of the professors at my school, and it has been an interesting experience so far. I wanted to post updates on the blog about the things I&#8217;m learning, and how I&#8217;m finding the job.

So far, I&#8217;ve been playing catch-up for the last few weeks. I&#8217;m attempting to learn the basics of general relativity, and it hasn&#8217;t been a simple task. The reason is that I&#8217;ve only taken my basic physics and mathematics courses, so while I do have the mathematical tools of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra, I don&#8217;t have things like calculus of variations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and so on. As such, it hasn&#8217;t been easy to generalize my mathematical tools to curved spaces.

I&#8217;ve been learning by going through a textbook, which has its ups and downs. The book is Sean Carroll&#8217;s _Spacetime and Geometry_, and I like the book and the author, but I feel like restricting oneself to only a textbook makes it difficult to learn the material fully. The book packs in a lot of information, but it&#8217;s often at the expense of carefully going through each result. I&#8217;m sure for those who have more background to the subject, the book would flow well. The trouble is that I can get stuck on a single line for a long time, simply because no explanation is provided and I don&#8217;t know what to do. That&#8217;s where learning the subject with someone else would be helpful. The ability to ask a question right when it comes up could make learning the material so much easier. This is exactly what I try to do as a tutor when I help younger students. I want them to feel confident in what they&#8217;re doing, but be able to ask a question whenever it comes up.

Despite the difficulties, I do like what I&#8217;m doing. Learning is something that I truly enjoy, so I am happy to do the difficult job of learning a subject on my own. The ideas are interesting, and the mathematics that I&#8217;m learning is also useful, so I know that whatever I learn will indeed be useful. I think the key is to keep on pressing with the material, and by working with the ideas, I&#8217;ll get more familiar and comfortable with the subject. I&#8217;m enjoying the start of my summer work, and I can see myself doing this kind of stuff for a long time to come.
