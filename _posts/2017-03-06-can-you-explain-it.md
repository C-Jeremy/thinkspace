Despite needing to compute many quantities in my various physics and mathematics classes, I like to take a slightly different approach to studying for a test. First, I will do a bunch of practice problems in order to strengthen the &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; of how to do certain types of questions. This usually means going over assignments and doing examples. This particularly helps with refreshing my mind for questions I haven&#8217;t done in a few weeks.

However, this isn&#8217;t the complete extent to which I prepare for my tests. When it is the night before my test, I make sure to review concepts instead of specific problems. What this means is that I won&#8217;t be doing actual calculations. Instead, I&#8217;ll make sure I can explain the steps that I need to do in order to solve certain questions. What this does is refresh my mind to the types of questions that may be asked during the test, and I find this gives me the confidence that I know what I am talking about. While some may simply do the exact homework problems again, I want to make sure that I can adapt to something different on the test. My hope is that doing this will get me thinking about the concepts in general.

As such, I&#8217;d suggest trying the same during one of your tests. Don&#8217;t just do the practice problems and call it a day. Make an effort to be able to explain what you&#8217;re doing and the things you should be looking for in order to solve certain questions.
