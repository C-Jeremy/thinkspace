When I was in secondary school, I really hated going to French class (I still wouldn&#8217;t particularly enjoy it). It wasn&#8217;t that the teacher was horrible or anything. Instead, it was simply because I didn&#8217;t like taking language classes other than English. I really excelled in English, and the huge chasm in my abilities in French versus English weren&#8217;t something I liked being reminded of. In English, not only was I well read and could write, I could also _speak_ well. Conversely, speaking was my weakest link in French. It&#8217;s frustrating being able to know all the words that you want to say in your head (and even being able to _think_ them), but not be able to actually express them. As such, I didn&#8217;t participate in class at all, preferring to only listen.

The result of this was that I came close to getting a horrible mark in the class for never participating. Since I didn&#8217;t want that, I changed my habits about halfway through the term and participated as needed. I even found that participating made me more engaged in the class, rather than just waiting for it to end.

The thing I see over and over again in a science or mathematics class now that I am out of secondary school and into higher education is the _lack_ of participation in class. And I know it&#8217;s not because the students aren&#8217;t listening or are bored. Rather, no one participates because we are scared to be wrong. Almost _every_ time a professor asks a question in my classes, they are met with silence, because we never want to answer a question and be wrong. I&#8217;m definitely a part of this group, and I struggle with this all the time.

Rationally, there&#8217;s no better place to be wrong than when giving answers to teachers. If the teacher is doing their job correctly, a mistake in an answer is an opportunity to expand someone&#8217;s mind and teach them a way to think. Done wrong, it makes a student feel unwelcome to share their answers again, most likely closing the door on future participation. I feel this all the time in class, and it&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t answer all that often. However, I&#8217;d almost wager that I _am_ one of the most frequent contributors, showing just how infrequent we participate in class.

Being on the other end of the situation, I know that it&#8217;s not a fun feeling when no one wants to answer the question you pose in class. As such, I struggle _not_ answering in class. After all, it makes _no_ difference if I get something wrong in class. Who cares if others think I&#8217;m an idiot for asking the question? Who cares if it&#8217;s obvious to everyone else, but not me?

Personally, I&#8217;ve always struggled with this to some degree. I&#8217;m not actually shy, but I&#8217;m always so obsessed with being &#8220;good&#8221; at subjects that I don&#8217;t want to appear like I&#8217;m a novice. Therefore, I try to hide my lack of knowledge by doing the &#8220;rough work&#8221; at home, so I can appear to be knowledgeable during class. The truth, of course, is that the class is there for me to learn, not to know everything before we start.

This is why I encourage participation in mathematics and science class. We need to stop being worried about what others will think of our hypotheses and ideas. Yes, people will judge them, but who really cares? On an intellectual level, I know that asking questions and giving answers in class (even if I&#8217;m not sure about them) is a way to _help_ me, not hinder me. As such, it&#8217;s one of my personal goals to work on, and I hope you can reflect on this as well. Do you participate in school, even when you aren&#8217;t sure about your answer? Do you ask questions, no matter how dumb? If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, I encourage you to work on this with me.

Participation in class is a key component to learning. Do what most people aren&#8217;t, and use it.
