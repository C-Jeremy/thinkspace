Many of us think we need to be influential or wealthy in order to be generous. After all, that's how we can do things for others. Without influence or wealth, we can't help people out like we want to.

The problem with this view is that it ignores the most precious gift you can give: your time.

Whoever you are, you have this gift of time. You get as much as anyone else, which means you can be just as generous as another person.

The question, therefore, is simple: Now that you know you *can* be generous, will you?
