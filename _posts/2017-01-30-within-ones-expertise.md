Because I am a tutor for secondary students, most people assume that I know everything that needs to be known about those classes. However, that could not be further from the truth. In fact, I frequently encounter problems that the students I help have that I cannot answer. It&#8217;s not even that I don&#8217;t know the answer. Sometimes, it&#8217;s just so far back in my mind that I don&#8217;t remember what the exact steps are.

When this happens, I don&#8217;t beat around the bush and pretend I know the answer. I tell them I have no clue, and that we&#8217;ll work it out. The reason I do this is twofold. First, it&#8217;s probably true, since a lot of the secondary mathematics is straightforward after doing more advanced mathematics. But the second reason is that I want to show them that I am not a robot that knows all the answers to their questions. I&#8217;m a student just like them (even if I become a teacher as well), and I&#8217;m constantly learning. I want them to know that I am just like they are, expect a few years further down the line. That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not a mathematical prodigy or someone who can do all the calculations in their head. I&#8217;m just there to give them a hand when they need it.

This is why I&#8217;m not too scared of straying from my expertise. Yes, I may not have much experience in all the classes in secondary school (in fact, the majority of students I tutor this year are taking a class I&#8217;ve never taken), but there&#8217;s no harm in learning. Plus, learning this way also helps me become a better teacher in the future.

I&#8217;m definitely _not_ advocating for you to proclaim expertise in every area of your life. I&#8217;m just saying that if you are willing to put in the hard work to learn, it&#8217;s entirely possible to become more knowledgeable at anything. Therefore, don&#8217;t restrict yourself to your personal expertise where you are comfortable. Experiment, and try to learn new things.
