At first glance, the answer would be, &#8220;no&#8221;. However, giving that answer would be missing the point.

We all want to be experts. It doesn&#8217;t even matter _what_ the expertise is in. If you ask most people, they&#8217;ll gladly accept being an expert at nearly anything. This is because achieving a state of expertise means you are wise and went to the trials of _becoming_ an expert.

What is missed, however, is the fact that expertise _arises_ from mediocrity. To be an expert means to have been an amateur. It&#8217;s virtually impossible to leapfrog from not knowing _anything_ about a subject to being an expert. This simply does not happen.

Instead, expertise occurs as a result of a lot of practice. And, more importantly, being _wrong_.

We don&#8217;t like to be wrong. Often, being wrong feels like a personal attack on one&#8217;s character, as if we don&#8217;t feel as intellectual as the rest of our peers. We don&#8217;t like being wrong because we do not enjoy displaying a weakness to those in our social circles.

However, the reality is that expertise _requires_ you to be mediocre. There&#8217;s no shortcut. In a way, being an expert _means_ you&#8217;ve once been an amateur and have learned from all your mistakes. We don&#8217;t like to think of it like this, though, because experts are thought to be people who don&#8217;t get anything wrong.

What we need to realize, then, is that those who become experts have become experts because they&#8217;ve accepted the journey to get there. Mainly, they&#8217;ve accepted that being mediocre is just a phase in a process. Being only a phase, they realize that it _will_ come to an end, and eventually lead to being an expert.

It&#8217;s a comforting myth to spread, but it&#8217;s wrong. Experts become experts as a _result_ of being mediocre, not in spite of. Therefore, if _you_ want to be an expert at what you do, embrace the phase of mediocrity. Through hard work, you&#8217;ll find that it is only a phase and does get better.

The path to expertise always includes mediocrity.
