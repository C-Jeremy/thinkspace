When we are pressured, we go back to our defaults. It&#8217;s something that we do both physically (such as in sports), and in our daily lives.

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to create defaults that are what we deem &#8220;good&#8221;. These are the things you&#8217;re going to fall back on when life gets hectic and you can&#8217;t add anything more.

During these times, you&#8217;re going to unconsciously move to your defaults. If you&#8217;re defaults are _good_, you can rest assured knowing that you will continue making a bit of progress in your craft.

The challenge, then, is to figure out how to change your defaults. The answer can be seen from sports, expressed as such:

_If you want to get better at badminton, don&#8217;t shoot free throws._

Put another way: specificity is key. The more you practice your craft, the more the habit will become ingrained. Furthermore, the _way_ in which you practice your craft will become habit as well. This is what your defaults will become.

Every day, you have a choice in the things you do. By taking the time to create better defaults for yourself, you&#8217;re gaining an advantage. Instead of being at the whims of your defaults when the stress in life is at a maximum, you&#8217;ll be content with what you do.
