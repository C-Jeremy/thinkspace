It&#8217;s appealing to think of ourselves as the result of a single choice to do something great, as if the best writers in the world suddenly decided &#8220;I want to be a great writer&#8221; and then became one. One choice, and then our path is set before us.

It&#8217;s a nice thought, but it&#8217;s also dead wrong.

The reality is that our lives are shaped by the countless choices we make, every single day. These choices are both big and small, and also have _apparent_ weights to them. Said differently, there are plenty of choices that we _think_ are important, but ultimately don&#8217;t matter in the long run (and vice versa). Our lives are a patchwork of these choices, one piled on top of the other. They aren&#8217;t layered neatly either. If you were to try and &#8220;follow the thread&#8221; of your choices back in time, things will tend to overlap and be confusing.

Therefore, it&#8217;s important to realize that people aren&#8217;t made from a few choices, both good and bad. Just because someone made a bad choice doesn&#8217;t mean that _all_ of their decisions are equally terrible. Even more important is the realization that one good choice doesn&#8217;t insulate someone from making a bad choice. What this means is that good people can make bad choices. And bad people can make good choices.

What this _also_ means is that the labels of &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; aren&#8217;t appropriate. People can be many things, and they are the result of a million choices taken in their lives. It&#8217;s almost impossible to decipher and generalize someone&#8217;s personality from just a few of their choices.

Remember, people are a _collection_ of choices, not just one or two.
