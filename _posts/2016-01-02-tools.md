Does it feel like you always seem to be missing that _one_ thing that will revolutionize the way you work?

Almost everyone answers &#8220;yes&#8221; to this question. Yearning for something new is a trait that most of us possess. We _love_ to see how a new piece of equipment or a new tool will change how we work. If I just had that _one_ app, I could become a better writer/drawer/thinker/_insert chosen passion_.

The problem with this thought is that it is always in anticipation. Instead of being satisfied once we get something, we quickly begin looking for a new alternative that will help even _more_. We chuck the old for the new, and the vicious cycle continues. We forget that the tools themselves shouldn&#8217;t be the main goal, but just a _means_ of creating fantastic work.

99% of the time, the tools aren&#8217;t as important as the work you are using them for.
