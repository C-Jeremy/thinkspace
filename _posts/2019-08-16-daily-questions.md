Am I challenging myself on a consistent basis?

Am I keeping an open mind? Relatedly, am I letting new things *into* that open mind?

Am I asking questions?

Am I taking responsibility and putting in the extra effort for pursuits and causes that I believe in?

What am I putting off because I'm afraid?

Have I reflected on the good parts of my day, instead of ruminating on the bad?

Did I make one personâ€™s life better?

Asking yourself these questions on a daily basis can be an eye-opening experience.
