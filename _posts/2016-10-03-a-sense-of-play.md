In mathematics, there&#8217;s a sense of play that must be achieved if one wants to _really_ understand what is going on in mathematics. Contrary to what people might think, this sense of play and &#8220;just getting&#8221; mathematics is not some sort of genetic feature (or at the very least, not _only_ genetic). It&#8217;s the result of immersing oneself in mathematics and freely playing with the concepts. After a long time, this play translates into what people call &#8220;intuition&#8221;.

Have you ever opened up a graphing calculator program and tried out different functions? Have you looked at their features and thought, &#8220;this is interesting&#8221;? Have you ever opened up your mathematics book and simply read it of your own accord to see if there were cool things you had missed?

_That_ is what it means to have a sense of play.

Having a knack for mathematics is not so different from being good at a sport, or a musical instrument. Sure, having the right technical skills is important, but being _really_ good at something requires one to experiment and refine one&#8217;s process. In this sense, trying new things and playing with numbers, functions, and other mathematical concepts is key to improving one&#8217;s &#8220;skill&#8221; in mathematics.

This sort of aptitude doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate to solving more complex problems or suddenly learning new concepts faster. What it _does_ do is give one a better way to &#8220;see&#8221; a concept, making it more approachable and familiar instead of challenging because one does not know how to proceed.

Develop a sense of play in mathematics and test things. Take out a piece of paper and try some equations out just for the fun of it, and you may surprise yourself by the relationships and patterns you find.
