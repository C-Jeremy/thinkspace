Hi there!

This blog is about mathematics, science, and a student trying to wrap his head around both.

I'm hoping to use this space to work through various ideas I'm thinking about. For the most part, these ideas will revolve around mathematics, science, and education, but I'm not opposed to delving into other topics. I hope that if some of these ideas pique your interest, you will join me as I explore them.

If you want to follow the blog, the best way is by subscribing through [RSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed). I respect your time, so there aren't any advertisements or other distractions. There are only words (and an occasional illustration). This is a labour of love. My gift to you, the reader.
